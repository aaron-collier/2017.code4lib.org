            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Don't forget your conference nametag and lanyard!</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Using plain words: </strong>
                From the Luskin Center, walk north on Westwood Plaza and take an immediate right after the Engineering Building. Walk up Portola Plaza. When the Mathematical Sciences Building is on your right, make a left and Kerckhoff Hall will be on your left.<br />
                Alternatively, you can walk through Ackerman Hall to get to Kerckhoff Hall.

            <dl>
                <dt>When: </dt><dd>Wednesday, March 8th, 2017, 6:30 pm - 10:30 pm</dd>

            <p>Play games? Have some homemade (or “homemade”) treats to share? Want to find folks to play music with? We organized a large open room near the conference center with plenty of space for attendees to gather and socialize, play games and share goodies. We will provide tables and chairs for Board Game Night and some space for jam sessions. You are also welcome to bring stuff to share, from craft sodas and beers to baked goods to local treats - we’ll have a few tables set up for that as well.</p>
            <p>For more information and to add to the list of games, check the <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/2017_Social_Activities#Play_and_Share.2C_Wednesday.2C_March_8th">code4lib wiki</a></p>
