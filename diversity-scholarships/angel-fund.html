				<h2>Diversity Scholarships Angel Fund</h2>
				<p>
					As part of the Code4Lib community's ongoing commitment to helping under-represented groups excel in
					computing and technology, we offer multiple scholarships to attend the annual conference. In addition
					to <a href="/prospectus/index.html#Diversity-Scholarships">seeking organization sponsors</a>
					for scholarships, we are now able to accept donations from individuals who would like to support the
					scholarship program. Individual donors will be thanked on the <a href="/sponsors/">Sponsors</a>
					page, though anonymous donation is also possible.

				</p>
				<p>
					All funds raised will help pay for transportation, accommodation, and conference registration costs
					for Code4Lib's Diversity Scholarships recipients for our annual conference. Please feel free to
					direct any question to the <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/2017_Conference_Committees#Scholarship_Committee">Scholarship Committee</a>
