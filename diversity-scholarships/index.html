        <p>
            As part of Code4lib's ongoing commitment to eliminating barriers that prevent participation for underrepresented
            groups, we are pleased to announce that we are now seeking applicants for our 2016 Diversity Scholarship program.
            The Code4Lib Scholarship Committee will award 10 Diversity Scholarships, based on merit and need. Each
            scholarship will cover travel costs, lodging, and conference fees for selected applicants to attend the
            <a href="http://2016.code4lib.org/">2016 Code4Lib Conference</a>, which will be held in Philadelphia, PA, March 7-10, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Applications are due by December 11, 2015 at 5 PM EST</strong> (<a href="#how-to-apply">see below for more details</a>).
        </p>

        <h4>This program is made possible by the generosity of our sponsors and community</h4>
