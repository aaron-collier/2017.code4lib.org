        </div>
        The Code4Lib community aims to make the conference accessible for attendees 
        of all abilities.

        <h2>Accessibility at the Conference</h2>
        <p>Code4Lib 2007 strives to be an accessible and inclusive space for all
           attendees. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Accommodation Requests</h3>
        <p>When registering, attendees were asked to include any accessibility needs
           they might require. We are doing our best to meet these needs. Everyone is
           encouraged to contact the accessibility committee (LINK NEEDED) if they have
           questions or new accommodation needs arise.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Live Captioning</h3>
        <p>During the general conference, Code4Lib 2017 will feature live captioning. 
           The captioning will be projected on secondary screens in the conference area.
           Attendees, both local and remote, may also view the text stream at <em>LINK
           TBA</em>.
        </p>                

        <h2>Accessibility Instructions for Presenters</h2>
        <p>All presenters should please review these accessibility requirements 
           and presentation logistics. Make note of the four action items for 
           your talk(s).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Action 1: PC/Mac Compatibility</h3>
        <p>Ensure that your slides will display correctly on BOTH Mac and PC. 
           There will be a presenter laptop at the podium to streamline transitions 
           and minimize tech issues. We don’t yet know if it will be a Mac or a PC. 
           If you absolutely need to use your own laptop (e.g. a demo that only 
           works on your machine), please let your Program Committee Liaison know ASAP.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Action 2: Submit Slides Early for Supporting Live Captioning</h3>
        <p>Code4Lib 2017 will feature live captioning during the three days of the 
           general conference. In order to improve the quality of this service, we 
           ask presenters to send their slides to us so that the captioners can use 
           them as reference and improve the quality of the live text stream. 
        </p>
        <p>Please submit your slides to Aaron Collier 
           (<a href="mailto:"acollier@calstate.edu?Subject=Code4Lib%20Slides">acollier@calstate.edu</a>)
           at least 24 hours before your presentation (the earlier the better). 
        </p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can continue to edit and change your slides 
           after submission. You do not need to resubmit any changes unless you 
           feel you added any difficult words or terms that would be challenging 
           for live captioning. Keep in mind that the captioners may not have domain
           expertise in libraries. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Action 3: Design a Visually Accessible Presentation</h3>
        <p>Presenters are encouraged to use the following guidelines to ensure that
           their presentations are visually accessible to attendees.
        </p>
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid fonts that use thin strokes in the characters.
            <li>Choose readable sans serif or serif fonts. Generally avoid script or
                monospaced fonts.                
            </li>
            <li>Suggested fonts include: Helvetica and its clones (Arial, Calibri, 
                etc.), Gill Sans, Comic Sans (seriously!), Verdana, Franklin Gothic, 
                Rockwell, Tahoma, Lucida, and Times New Roman.
            </li>
o	        <li>Use underlining, italics, and boldface sparingly.
            </li>Aim for a font size of 20-30 point. Generally, do not go below 
                 18-point for slide content (if you plan to share your slides
                 with the community, it’s okay to use smaller fonts for references 
                 and URIs).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose text and background colors that have good contrast. You can
                use a <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast 
                checker</a> to check for good constrast. The web accessibility thresholds
                are not relevant to slide presentations, but higher contrast is still better.
            </li>
            <li>For color blindness considerations, add patterns or labels in graphs and charts.
                This is especially important if are using either red-green or yellow-blue
                color combinations. These are the two most common types of color blindness.
                If you are uncertain about a color choice, a <a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">color
                blindness simulator</a> may help.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Videos/Animations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid blinking text and animations that endlessly repeat.
            </li>
            <li>If your presentation features lots of animations, videos, etc., 
                please include a warning at the start of your talk. This is especially
                needed if any contain lots of flicker.
            </li>
            <li>If a video contains sound or dialogue, please try to use a version
                with captioning.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sharing Slides</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants are encouraged to share their slides. If placed on the
                web, please include a short link in your opening slides for attendees
                to view on their personal machines.
            </li>
            <li>Include speaker notes with your files if the file format allows. 
                In particular, describe any images, tables, charts, etc. in the notes.
            </li>
            <li>Specific advice for different presentation tools and formats:
                <ul>
                    <li>PDFs: Use PDF/A format: <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/">
                        http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/</a>
                    </li>
