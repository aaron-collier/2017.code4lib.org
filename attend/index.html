                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There will be <strong>two opportunities to register</strong>. The first
                        registration period will start at 12 p.m. Eastern / 9 a.m. Pacific on
                        14 December 2016 for 277 slots.  Once we have determined
                        that all required attendees have registered (sponsors, presenters, workshop
                        leaders), we will reopen registration again in January; the specific
                        date will be announced later. The total capacity is 450.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The registration system maintains a two hour session per registration
                        attempt. Due to the potential of heavy access and this prolonged session,
                        the conference may appear to sell out quickly. But once early failed
                        sessions expire, more spots may open up beginning around 2 p.m. Because of
                        this we ask you not to assume it is sold out until you hear an announcement
                        from the planning committee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A waiting list will open when we release the second round of registration slots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conference program is not complete at this time.
                        See <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/results/42">the election results</a> to get an idea of what will be part of the program.
                        This list represents the presentation voting results. Only the top ten (highlighted)
                        have been accepted so far. As in recent years, the remainder of the program
                        will be curated by the program committee, taking into account voting
                        results, topic diversity, and speaker diversity. These selections will be
                        announced in coming weeks.

                    <li>
                        Registration will include the option to select preconference workshops.
                        You can view workshops as part of the registration form to get an
                        idea of what will be offered. <!-- Wait lists will be available for
                        workshops, and you will receive relevant instructions with your
                        confirmation email. -->

                <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
                <p>
                    The Code4Lib community seeks to provide a welcoming, safe, and fun conference environment for all
                    attendees. In support of this, all conference attendees are required to adhere to the
                    <a href="http://2017.code4lib.org/conduct/">Code4Lib Code of Conduct</a> throughout the entire
                    conference including pre-conference and post-conference activities in all event venues both physical
                    and virtual including presentations, workshops, or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.
                </p>

                <h3>Registration Cancelation Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    All cancellations received on or
                    before February 6, 2017 are eligible for a full refund of
                    fees paid, less a 10% cancellation fee. No refunds will be
                    issued after the February 6 cut-off date.
                </p>

                <h3>Giveaway Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    You must be present to win a "giveaway prize".  Names will be selected at random from the list of
                    attendees. Giveaway raffles are held in the main conference room, just after meals and breaks.
                    Meal and break times are listed in the daily schedules.
                </p>

                <h3>Photography Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Do not photograph, film, or audio-record anyone at Code4Lib without their expressly-given permission
                    beforehand. Color- and pattern-coded lanyards are available at the registration desk to help indicate
                    the wearer’s preference for photography ONLY. Please note, regardless of lanyards, you must always
                    ask before filming or audio-recording attendees.
                </p>

                <h4>Lanyard color code</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solid green printed with {code4lib}: Photographs always okay – this represents expressly-given permission beforehand</li>
                    <li>Yellow: Ask before photographing</li>
                    <li>Red: Photographs never okay, don’t ask</li>
