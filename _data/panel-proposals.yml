  panel-title: "Technical evaluation of long term  sustainability of mainstream digital library systems including Dspace/Fedora/ContentDM/ResCarta/Omeka/Islandora."
  description: "A look under ther covers at how popular library systems store their data. The panel will present the structure of each system and it's strengths and weaknesses in relation to long term preservation and reuse."

  panel-title: "The Good, The Bad, The Impossible to Ascertain: ILS Migrations in 2017"
  description: "The Integrated Library System traditionally has been the monolithic centerpiece of library technologies, with the most pervasive influence on staff workflows, metadata quality, and patron experience. With such complex and often old software, moving to newer options presents a number of challenges. In this panel, three technology librarians who recently undertook ILS changes will discuss their migration processes and the state of the ILS in 2017. Topics will include the technological and organizational motivations for migration, difficulties in translating data between systems, choosing open source or proprietary software, and the effect of major system changes on library staff."

  panel-title: "Sharing and Publishing Data"
  description: It sounds like most institutions who deal with data have a slightly different take on the standards and goals that we build into our data repositories.  This panel would open up the table for a candid discussion of the needs and realities of data creators and curators in various settings.

  panel-title: "Using NoSQL & Semantics for Managing and Creating Smart Content"
  description: This panel will discuss how organizations like The Library of Congress and the Entertainment Technology Center at the University of Southern California are using semantics and NoSQL to manage digital content. This discussion will focus on the benefits of using linked data for data governance and software application development. The panel will discuss BIBFRAME -  the Bibliographic Framework Initiative and how it uses RDF and a linked data model for expressing and connecting bibliographic data. Also, the panel will review how the Entertainment Technology Center at USC used NoSQL and semantic data modeling to capture descriptive motion picture metadata to a create smart, intuitive software application for “The Suitcase Project.”

  panel-title: "Developing Research Data Management Services: Platforms, Policies, and Open Data"
  description: "This proposal is similar to my traditional-session proposal, but I would be very interested in crafting the idea as a panel, if this works better in this format:  Each year the volume of research data produced grows exponentially. The capacity to share, analyze, process, and re-use this vital scholarly material is central to the advancement of knowledge. Research institutions are expanding data services—assisting with data management plans and funder mandates, archiving data in institutional repositories, mediating intellectual property law, and facilitating access to open data. How do these services fit into current organizational workflows? Do allocated resources adequately address needs? What platforms and interfaces offer the most support and flexibility for RDM preservation? What are intersections with tangential fields like digital archiving, data science, and digital humanities? What emerging technologies and metrics are ideal in a data curation environment? This panel will examine technical and administrative considerations, and share lessons learned when establishing research data management services."

  panel-title: "Introducing Archival Principles into UCLA Undergraduate Courses with Digital Humanities Projects"
  description: "The world of digital humanities is rapidly growing, and if student digital humanities projects are to be seen as robust and legitimate research, then the emerging literacies skills necessary to produce that high level of research, including primary sources; proper attributions and citations; and clear metadata and documentation need to be integrated into classroom as part of the syllabus. Faculty and information professionals, then, should be encouraged to collaborate and set up an infrastructure for the course in which students learn archival principles and why it is important for research and then have the chance to put the principles into practice through following simplified professional standards in archival description and digitization. The timing in making sure students provide clear metadata and documentation for the work they contribute is critical given the transient nature of undergraduate students who are typically only in a course for a term. Once an academic term has passed, it is infinitely more difficult to retroactively gather any information or metadata not already provided to the department or university. As universities begin to incorporate digital humanities projects into undergraduate courses in a wide range of disciplines, there is a growing need for information professionals to collaborate with faculty to introduce archival principles into the course in order to ensure an accurate archival record of student work and contribution to these projects as the courses unfold."
