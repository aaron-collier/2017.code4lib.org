  abstract: "We all encounter failure in our professional lives: failed projects, failed systems, failed organizations. We often think of failure as a negative, but it has intrinsic value -- and since it's inevitable that we'll eventually experience failure ourselves, it's important to know how to accept it, how to take lessons from it, and how to grow from it professionally. Fail4Lib, now in its 5th year, is the perennial Code4Lib preconference dedicated to discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all face in our professional lives. It is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants to be adept at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way that moves us forward. This half-day preconference will consist of case studies, round-table discussions, and, for those interested in sharing, lightning talks on failures we've dealt with in our own work."

  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "Calls to mindfulness and self care can have mixed reception in our field. While some view this important work as navel-gazing or unnecessary, it is integral to being present and avoiding burnout. Often this skewed attention to output comes at the expense of our personal lives, our organizations, our health, our relationships, and our mental well-being. Learning to prioritize self-care is an ongoing project among those who perform emotional labor. While some view the work of mindfulness as self-indulgent, it has proven to keep many on the track of being present and avoiding burnout.*
<br><br>
The purpose of this preconference is to provide a short introduction to self care and mindfulness with practical work we can use regardless of setting. We’ll discuss microaggressions and allyship (microaggressions being the brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities that marginalized people of various groups experience daily and allyship referring to the powerful role that individuals from privileged groups can play in supporting marginalized individuals). We will then transition to a modified unconference setting where participants can practice scenarios and learn practical solutions. Each of the presenters has different set of skills and experiences that allow for many techniques and strategies to be explored. Preconference attendees will participate in sessions like “Mentor Speed Dating” where they get to talk to and question potential mentors/mentees. They may be coached through a guided meditation or walked through a calming breathing exercise. For those looking to a more physical space, office yoga and stretching techniques may be shared depending on the outcomes of the unconference interest.
<br><br>
Foundational materials and articles will be shared with the registrants prior to the meeting with the option of further discussion at the workshop. An open access guide to all the resources and readings will be available after the preconference, and people will be encouraged to share additional their tools on a website.

  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "This half-day workshop is an overview and hands-on introduction to the Open Science Framework and the SHARE data set, two tools that form a powerful combination for supporting scholarship and research locally as well as improving scientific integrity and allowing for new forms of meta-research.
<br><br>
Developed by the Center for Open Science, the Open Science Framework (OSF; http://osf.io) is a free, open source tool that works within the research workflow to allow for better management, curation, streamlining, and sharing of scholarly outputs. SHARE builds its free, open, data set (https://share.osf.io/) by gathering, cleaning, linking, and enhancing metadata that describe research activities and outputs—from data management plans and grant proposals to research data and code, to preprints, presentations, and journal articles.
<br><br>
In this workshop, participants will learn to use the OSF to develop embedded data stewardship and research management services for faculty. Attendees will also learn how to leverage and enhance SHARE data to improve their institutions’ understanding of the whole scholarship ecosystem happening on their campuses.
<br><br>
This workshop will be divided into two parts. First, attendees will learn strategies to provide curation and research services to the faculty workflow by operating in the OSF. Practical approaches to faculty collaborations and curation assistance throughout the research life cycle will be discussed. The second part will focus on harnessing the power of the SHARE data set to discover and act upon the research outputs of an institution or organization. This hands-on portion of the workshop will use IPython/Jupyter Notebooks to access the SHARE API and search across 129+ different providers and export and clean the metadata.
<br><br>
Participants are encouraged to bring laptops in order to follow along. No previous programming experience is necessary.
<br><br>
Learning Outcomes:<br>
Understand how the OSF works within the researcher workflow and how it can improve scientific integrity while also fostering collaboration.<br>
Learn to leverage the SHARE API to better understand the intellectual and scientific contributions of a university.<br>
Develop an understanding of the basics of good data-management practices."

  preconference-title: "How Do We Keep Voting?: Sustaining Open Source Tools in a Community-Driven Environment"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: All day
  abstract: "In recent years, Code4Lib’s growth as a vital, evolving Open Source community has begun to highlight a common issue in software deployment and service management: what happens when the growth of users outpaces the ability to update or maintain software that serve as integral tools to the community, like our conference voting service?
<br><br>
We are just one of many communities facing this problem.  In this pre-conference, we seek to re-examine the model for developing and maintaining open source tools in a community-driven environment and address the problem of how to continue to provide services in a sustainable way.  Current workflows based on aging, increasingly inflexible software that is carried on the backs of one or two individuals with no institutional buy-in to continue support is not sustainable or fair to expect.
<br><br>
The first half of this pre-conference will focus on the big picture, detailing the new role that software plays in providing services to an organization or community. We will develop sustainable strategies for implementing software and building a blueprint for using open source tools to meet software-addressable needs, examining and considering the need fulfilled rather than the software used.  In the second half of the day, we will apply these strategies to the case study of diebold-o-tron, Code4Lib’s trusty voting software, currently maintained and deployed annually through the generosity of individuals, and develop a pilot strategy for treating this as a service maintained by a community rather than a piece of software maintained by an individual.
<br><br>
Attendees will come away with:<br>
- New perspectives on software’s role in a service-based organizational ecosystem<br>
- Strategies for building team models needed to sustainably support software in a community or organization<br>
- Methods for identifying healthy Open Source projects and programming languages to develop a sustainable infrastructure
<br><br>
Sustainable software is developed at many levels beyond the code itself.  For this workshop, we seek the input and collaboration of everyone in the Code4Lib community -- service and project managers, developers, and most of all, users."

  abstract: "Building applications and microservices using the power and flexibility of Linked Data through RDF triplestores present libraries and cultural heritage institutions an incredible opportunity to grow and manage extensible knowledge graphs for their patrons, institutions, and communities. Participants will be presented with these three examples of RDF-based applications and services that use bibliographic and organizational information modeled in BIBFRAME 2.0 and Schema.org RDF triples:<br>
      1.  Colorado College Senior Thesis Self-Submission Application (https://github.com/Tutt-Library/ccetd.git) - This application allows seniors at Colorado College to self-submit their thesis along with any accompanying datasets, video, or audio to Colorado College's Fedora-based institutional repository. Modeling the institutional, departmental, and faculty relationships as RDF Schema.org linked-data for this application provided the additional benefit of being the genesis of Colorado College's mo re general knowledge graphs for other uses instead of being isolated in an application silo.<br>
    2. The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries BIBCAT Pilot (https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/alliance-bibcat.git) - Using selected MARC 21 records from Colorado College and the University of Colorado Boulder that were generated from the Alliance's Gold Rush comparison service, this project uses the BIBCAT -short for bibliographic catalog- an open-source project originally funded by a contract for the Library of Congress to transform MARC 21 into BIBFRAME that is then published to the web as Schema.org JSON-LD for indexing by Google, Bing, and other search engines. BIBCAT uses RDF rules that map MARC 21 fields and subfields to BIBFRAME 2.0 entities and properties.<br>
    3. DP.LA Service Hub for Colorado and Wyoming (https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/dpla-service-hub.git) - A State Library of Colorado sponsored effort to aggregrate the metadata from across different libraries and museums in Colorado and Wyoming and provide a JSON-LD DPLA Map v4  feed to DP.LA. This project uses BIBCAT to transform different formats and vocabularies from multiple sources including Denver Public Library's RDF Dublin Core, Colorado College and University of Wyoming MODS metadata, and a metadata provided as custom CSV file from the History Colorado museum into BIBFRAME 2.0 entities stored in a triplestore. BIBCAT uses RDF-based rules to ingest these sources while allowing for easy customization and modification through simple editing of RDF turtle file.<br>
<br><br>
Unlike many Library Linked-Data events, this preconference's hands-on focus is to help participants start their own development of RDF applications and micro-services. While the focus will be partipatants on writing their own RDF rules using Turtle for manipulating their own metadata, participants will also be introduced to the underlying open-source Python and Haskell code used in the RDF Framework platform."

  preconference-title: "Gamification of Library Orientation and Instruction"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: All day
  abstract: "The rapid advent in the technologies of augmented and virtual reality (VR) in the last several years and the surge down in price creates possibilities for its increasing and ubiquitous application in education. A collaboration by a librarian and VR specialist led to testing opportunities to apply 360 video in academic library orientation. The team seeks to bank on the inherited interest of Millennials toward these technologies and their inextricable part of a growing gaming environment in education. A virtual introduction via 360 video aims to familiarize patrons with the library and its services: http://bit.ly/VRlib. I short Surveymonkey survey following the virtual introduction assesses learning outcomes and allows further instruction when necessary. Patrons can use any electronic devices from desktop to any size mobile devices. Patrons can also watch in panorama mode, and are provided with goggles if they would like to experience the VR mode.<br>
The next step is an introduction to basic bibliographic instruction, followed by a gamified “scavenger hunt”-kind of exercise, which aims to gamify students’ ability to perform basic research: http://bit.ly/learnlib. The game is web-based and it can be played on any electronic devices from desktops to mobile devices. The game is followed by a short Google Form survey, which assesses learning outcomes and allows further work shall any knowledge gaps occur.<br>
The team relies on the constructivist theory of assisting patrons in building their knowledge in their own pace and on their own terms, rather than being lectured and guided by a librarian only.<br>
This proposal envisions half a day activities for participants to study the opportunities presented by 360 video camera and acquire the necessary skills to collect quickly useful footage and process it for the library needs. The second half of the day is allocated for learning Adobe Dreamweaver to manipulate the preexisting “templates” (HTML and jQuery code) for the game and adapt the content and the format to the needs of the participants’ libraries.<br>

  preconference-title: "Getting Started with Ansible and Serverspec"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "Provisioning a server by hand is an onerous job, but it's one most library developers have done. And you've certainly heard that there are tools to help you manage this task in a more organized fashion.
<br><br>
This workshop will walk you through how to use Ansible [1], one such tool, to set up a new service on a new machine. The focus will be on hands-on learning, walking through the common mistakes one can make when using Ansible. You'll gain a confidence in the tool, and learn that the error messages Ansible returns are actually useful in finding those mistakes.
<br><br>
You will quickly discover that using Ansible is pretty similar to what you've previously done by hand. You may even have shell scripts written to help you with provisioning; those existing scripts can easily be modified to work with Ansible.
<br><br>
We will also make use of Serverspec [2], a tool which allows you to characterize the services running on an existing server, and then use this specification to test and verify the results of your efforts with Ansible.
<br><br>
Audience: developers, with some operations experience.
<br><br>
Requirements: participants should bring a notebook computer on which they have admin privileges. Ideally, participants should already have installed VirtualBox [3], Vagrant [4], and Git [5].

  preconference-title: "Modeling Concepts in Linked Data RDF"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "How does your library exist in the Linked Data world? Is it a foaf:Organization, a schema:Organization, org:Organization, etc? Once you've decided that, what properties does your library have? For example, is it called by an rdfs:label, or skos:prefLabel, or dcterms:title, or something else entirely?
<br><br>
These questions don't have a single correct answer, and therein lies the challenge of modeling data in RDF. Whether it's descriptive metadata, digital object relationships, or places, people, and things, you need to understand the options for mapping data and the pros and cons each mapping brings. This workshop will not be a presentation, but a collaboration: we are relying on attendees to provide concepts they've struggled to map in the Linked Data world. We would then go through the process of discussing as a group how to map those concepts and see if we can come to agreement as to the best approach(es).
<br><br>
Ideally the end result of this workshop will be more uniform linked data and more standardized practices shared between organization. Because while one can map anything into RDF, the real challenge is doing it in a way that others outside of your institution will be able to make sense of."

  preconference-title: "Natural Language Processing with Python: Getting Started"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, PM
  abstract: "Wherever there is text data, the need to parse, classify, and extract information may arise.  There exist two easy-to-use and battle-tested tools for Pythonistas to tackle text processing: NLTK and spaCy.  We’ll lead participants step by step through common NLP tasks using sample text data or their own text data.  We argue that classification is at the heart of most useful applications of NLP and that recognizing this key insight is the foundation for pulling meaning out of a sea of characters."

  preconference-title: "Islandora in the Wild: Training and Resources from Pilot and Production Repository Projects "
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "Islandora is an open source digital repository framework used to preserve and expose special collections, scholarly publications and research data. It combines the Drupal CMS and Fedora Commons repository software, together with additional open source applications. The framework delivers a wide range of functionality out-of-the-box and offers the flexibility of customization to meet emerging functional requirements.
<br><br>
This Islandora workshop will explore multiple uses and implementations of Islandora by community members such as Betsy Coles from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Zach Vowel of the California Polytechnic State University (Calpoly), Aaron Krebeck of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), and others. They will describe their digital projects, how Islandora was utilized, overall experience, and top takeaways.
<br><br>
The workshop will cover topics such as:<br>
- Single site and Consortial Repositories (governance, management, sustainability)<br>
- Metadata Wrangling (pre-processing, batch updating and XML forms)<br>
- Content Modelling Advancements (EADs, TEI, and more)<br>
- Batch Ingesting Content (via Drupal UI and Drush shell scripts)<br>
- Discovery & Harvesting (Solr, Search Engines, DPLA and more)
<br><br>
All examples will be taken from both pilot and production repositories. Users will leave with an understanding of the Islandora software framework and community, the underpinnings of Islandora content modelling and metadata requirements, the ability to batch ingest content, and the knowledge of how to expose repository content to search engines and aggregators for discovery and re-use.  We look forward to seeing you there! "

  preconference-title: "Web Accessibility: Becoming a Stronger Advocate"
  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, AM
  abstract: "Libraries must ensure that users of all abilities can successfully use the technologies we provide. Despite the many ethical and legal motivations, not all of our technologies meet accessibility standards. Ultimately, the responsibility for making technologies accessible falls to the developers and vendors, but it is the responsibility of library staff to facilitate accessibility of information to all patrons, regardless of ability. Advocacy from library staff of all levels and duties is crucial for ensuring that access for persons of differing abilities is a mandatory priority in library technology services.
<br><br>
This workshop is about providing library workers of all technical backgrounds with a foundation of  knowledge and skills to begin actively advocate for conformance to accessibility standards. Attendees will learn of key topics in accessibility: different ability types, types of assistive technologies, legislation and standards, and related issues of usability and respect. Although emphasis will not be placed on the finer details of implementing accessible design, relevant technologies and practices such as ARIA, screen readers, etc. will be covered. Heuristics and other simple independent accessibility testing practices will be taught and experienced through interactive exercises. Attendees will also gain practice in how to successfully converse with vendors and developers about accessibility. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a formidable toolkit of vocabulary, methods, and additional resources enable them to begin and grow their advocacy for equal access for all persons of differing abilities in their libraries and institutions.
<br><br>
This workshop is targeted at people new to web accessibility but also to anyone wanting to learn more. A survey sent prior to the conference will help determine the topics and depth to be covered. Some experience with HTML is desired but not required.

  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "Heard about APIs but don’t know where to start building something? Created an application using an API but don’t feel like it’s ready to share with others? This workshop will provide tips for how to identify and successfully incorporate APIs into a sharable application in a scalable fashion. We'll cover the basic principles, concepts and tools for interacting with APIs from authentication with OAuth to REST API patterns. Then we'll look at the coding techniques for making an API driven application sharable and scaleable. We’ll look at strategies for identifying and storing application configuration information; examine how to write tests for application and API interactions so you can be confident of the quality of your code and discuss techniques for ensuring that your application can be debugged in the event of a failure in the API. Lastly, we’ll talk about how manager community feedback and contributions to the applications.

  lengthtime-of-day-for-preconference: Half day, no preference for time
  abstract: "The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is set of technical specifications built around shared challenges in cultural heritage access. Many institutions have scanned large portions of their collections, producing a large body of high-quality images. To provide access to these images and supporting structure and information, IIIF describes an interoperable delivery and interface description method that has been used to address access and reuse of images at many of the world’s largest national and university research libraries, museums, archives, and galleries. A large and growing ecosystem of interoperable software has developed to support each step of image delivery and user experience. This workshop will provide an overview of the IIIF specifications and available software, hands-on training installing IIIF client and server software, and a question and answer session to address your institution’s use cases.
<br><br>
Workshop attendees do not need any prior experience with IIIF and all are welcome."
