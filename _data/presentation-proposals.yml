  presentation-title: "Performance of Python/Django vs. ColdFusion"
  abstract: "My office within the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) has used ColdFusion for many years for certain critical public applications such as MedlinePlus.  Now, NLM is re-writing many of our key applications in Python/Django. We like a lot of things about the framework and the language.  We are concerned that Python does not multi-thread well, especially compared to byte-code languages that run on a JVM.

In order to determine the number of Python/Django application servers required for on-premise applications, and the resource utilization at which cloud application servers must scale, we measure the response time of a ColdFusion server and a similar server running a Python/Django application generating the same HTML content.  We also configure a varnish cache in front of the Python/Django application server and measure this against static HTML on disk.

The methodology is simple - measure response time as a function of the number of concurrent clients.  The response time should be linear until a certain number of concurrent clients, and then exponential.   On the application server after the knee, we measure resource utilization and determine the best resource to signal scaling in the cloud.

We expect Python/Django to have a knee at a smaller number of concurrent client connections, because Python does not multi-thread well.   We are interested to see the differences in response time, but we have no theory here and expect it will be fast enough if the database connections and server are properly optimized.

In addition to pure performance measurement, we discuss performance optimizations on the Python/Django application and WSGI application server configuration.   Multiple WSGI application servers may be tried depending on the results with Phusion Passenger open-source."

  abstract: "After completing a reorganization of our stacks, the Georgetown University Library needs to perform an inventory of 900,000 books within our stacks.  This project needs to be completed before migrating our catalog to a new ILS (integrated library system) vendor in 2017.

The inventory tool options provided by our ILS vendor were ruled out due to cost and complexity.  After learning about a similar project at the University of Dayton Library, we decided to build our own application to support this effort.

The Georgetown University Library has developed an application that allows student workers with a barcode scanner and a Chromebook to rapidly move through the stacks and scan each item.  The tool queries the ILS database to verify the item's status and location, while allowing the user to verify the Title, Call Number and Volume of each item.  The tool will also highlight call number sorting errors with each scan.

This presentation will describe the solution that we have developed and the challenges that were overcome during the project.  The code (and a video demonstration of the project) are available at https://github.com/Georgetown-University-Libraries/BarcodeInventory.

  abstract: "Like many institutions, at the University of Virginia, we have in the past, done archival description using Microsoft word.  In order to better manage this descriptive and structural metadata (finding aids) it became necessary to migrate to a structured format.  In order to save time, we developed a tool to facilitate converting MS Word documents into EAD XML finding aids, which could then be imported into ArchivesSpace.  The tool helps in two main ways, first it allow for rule-based assignment of sections of the word document and exposes an XML-based rule language to allow arbitrary rules to be written.  For example, it's fairly easy to write a rule that says “treat the first line as the title“ or “treat all paragraphs below the heading 'scope and content' as paragraphs within a scopecontent tag“.  The second way the tool aids in the conversion is to expose a powerful user interface that allows sections of document to be assigned their place in the structured format, including drag-and-drop reordering and nesting as well as bulk handling of content that appears to be tabular.  Through it initial testing and use, lots of convenience features were added to the user interface.

The tool has since been adapted to support conversion of MS Word documents in other contexts.

So Sci-Hub's release, early in 2016, of complete, de-identified, usage logs would be a serious user-privacy breech to the extent that users can be re-identified.

I have explored re-identification of the Sci-Hub logs. Because of the nature of scholarly literature, I find that usage can frequently be tied to a small groups, and occasionally, to single individuals. In particular, article DOIs provide convenient keys to databases containing personally- identifiable information. Libraries that rely on log de-identification or anonymization to protect user privacy should be aware of the limitations of these strategies."

These feelings negatively impact our work, potential for future projects, and perception of our self-value. Feelings of IP extend into conference participation and attendance in which members of our community believe that they do not possess the skills to attend or benefit from conferences such as Code4Lib.

Current research on IP within library technology positions is scarce. This leaves our community with some questions: 1) how is IP affecting professional development and involvement? 2) Is IP influencing Code4Lib attendance and participation?

Through a survey, this study will measure 1) levels of IP within the Code4Lib and information professionals’ community, and 2) how IP influences community members’ perception of Code4Lib. Based on survey responses and research, this presentation will offer solutions as to how the Code4Lib community can help combat and prevent IP. These solutions can be applied to individuals of all skill and experience levels to promote confidence, professional development, and community involvement.

Even so, some locally generated content is poorly represented or missed altogether. At Los Alamos National Laboratory we have policies and workflows intended to populate the IR. A complimentary effort, Autoload, attempts to locate and harvest items that were missed. Autoload starts with basic metadata and in some cases, a version of the publication, and uses the APIs of several public services in an effort to locate and retrieve copies of the material that are appropriate for archiving. Autoload contends with several challenges: 1) can the content be archived locally, 2) can we find an archivable version of the publication, 3) how do we determine if what we have found is the correct version.We look capabilities of and challenges with using Crossref, Microsoft Academic, Romeo/Sherpa and oaDOI as part of a harvesting pipeline. We also consider aggregating, matching, and verifying metadata and content.

A static website might not be the first tool that comes to mind to accomplish this task, but it might actually be exactly what you are looking for. Static sites are fast, incredibly secure, and have a low technical barrier to deployment. Current static site generators, such as Jekyll, automate the painful aspects of static website creation and ongoing maintenance. All of which greatly reduce ongoing costs of long term maintenance of the site.

This talk will focus on the migration of a Rails website to a static website that was done to lower the technical debt of ongoing maintenance, while at the same time continuing and enhancing support for feature-rich aspects of the website such as search and content creation.

After receiving an Excel document filled with beautiful metadata, we decided that the benefits of exploring this hack outweighed the time needed to manually input and collocate XML tags in Excel or to develop a script.


Please join us for a brief discussion about the challenges and successes we encountered while using Microsoft Word’s mail merge tool to batch generate XML files.

  abstract: "Article writing is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor and one that is only made less attractive
by the prospect of producing several versions for various publisher workflows and specifications. An additional,
undesirable effect is that the end result of these processes do not lend themselves easily to metadata extraction or customizability and reusability without some sort of mediation.

We propose a simplified document language, FINNEGAN, that fosters a type of article creation that allows for automated metadata extraction which can be piped into different standards and systems, as well as make use of embedded identifiers and other syntactic structures to create an RDF graph of the article's universe. By moving away from ultra-stylized word processing tools, the publishing workflow can facilitate a more fluid and extensible product that serves a larger variety of library and publishing needs.

This presentation will explain the FINNEGAN model, its benefits, syntax, as well as how it can be incorporated
into existing tools like Pandoc. Attention will also be given to the (very real) adoption challenges it faces and how
these can be recast as innovative opportunities in reevaluating existing metadata and publishing models."

As we strive to navigate this space with collaborative, transparent, and data-savvy decisions about our collections, we need tools and processes adequate to the task. This presentation addresses this need by way of a question: What can collection development learn from software development?


At the George Washington University, we have been using code libraries like pandas (for Python) and D3 (for Javascript) to harvest, analyze, and visualize data about our collections in ways that promote improved workflows and decision-making. For instance, a lightweight data warehouse and dashboard allows stakeholders to track allocations and expenditures, providing functionality not available in our ILS (source code at https://github.com/dolsysmith/voyager-dashboard). Likewise, agile methods supply a framework for iterative and collaborative work on collection development projects, breaking the mold of relatively solitary acquisition under a horizon of diminishing returns, in order to make more strategic investments of money and staff time. Examples from our use of these tools and methods will highlight how synergies between collection development and software development can help us tackle the challenges and leverage the opportunities libraries face in the twenty-first century."

When getting things done takes less time, assessment is that much more meaningful, allowing for continuous improvement of services. With IT and librarians working more on the same page, priorities become shared, trust between departments improves, and the patron’s experience becomes better. Can this magical world exist in real life?

  presentation-title: "#WomenInTech & beyond: Salary negotiation process, how to not lose your head"
  abstract: "When we don’t negotiate, what do we lose? There’s a systemic reluctance to negotiate for a higher salary or benefits package especially as a woman in tech, but this is not confined to just women. There is a pay gap; helping to close it requires negotiating with employers to compensate us for our actual worth. If we do not negotiate and we undersell ourselves, we allow that wage gap to remain.

Salary negotiation is intimidating and difficult to navigate if you don’t have the right tools and knowledge to do so. You need to know how to assess your value, identify target salaries, ask the right way, respond to red flags, and evaluate a total benefits package. Negotiating takes having a strategy in place and knowing tactics to be successful. Of course, success isn’t always the outcome and you may choose to walk away from a job offer. Knowing your breaking point is also important.

We’ve had our fair share of successes and failures in past negotiations at a variety of institution types (public and academic libraries, state government, and private corporations). This talk will present what we’ve learned and share tools and tactics that helped us along the way."

  abstract: "Research institution managers need to increase visibility, understanding and value of their department’s research work. They need to demonstrate how primary research increases perception of their institution’s value to donors and others and have measurements to back up their statements and reasoning. Librarians play a key role in enabling research activities and online information exchange.

Citation count tools provide some explanation of potential awareness of published research. Researchers increasingly use online and social media resources to promote research activities. The challenge is to harness this online chatter to enable a better awareness of the extended value of their research.

Funders are increasingly requiring evidence of broader impacts and dissemination of research efforts to ensure money provided is being used to its maximum. Tools are becoming available to measure attention to formal research discussed online. These tools are referred to as alternative or enhanced metrics, often called altmetrics. They enable tracking of attention to research articles and provide numbers of views, demographics on viewers and other attention measurements.

This presentation uses a case study at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to focus on why altmetrics are important to senior management in research institutions. The analysis review includes an overview of data compiled using the Altmetric for Institutions tool from Altmetric, a Digital Science company. It explains the conclusions reached and how librarians can utilize altmetrics tools to expand the understanding of the value of their information services to support an institution’s mission and goals.

  abstract: "Streaming videos are a larger share of our libraries licensed collection and demand driven offerings. We rely on MARC records to populate our discovery layer since the videos are not indexed to the degree of journals and eBooks. This means that the quality and extent of MARC encoded description are crucial to the discovery of the streaming video for the people who use the library. It is established that we can develop automated pre-load error checks for eBooks and doing the same for streaming videos is possible. This talk will, at a high level, discuss what types of checks are specific for streaming videos and which of those are better suited for pre-loading and post-loading. Then, I will survey and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of free products for pre-load or post-load checks as compared to customized checks developed through PyMarc, a Python library for working with MARC data. The talk will provide Python equivalent examples for various components of the error check products. The outcome will be to provide an entry point for easing creation and sharing of Python error checks and establishing a community of practice around batch loading of high-quality streaming videos MARC records.

  abstract: "This talk will introduce the concept of Coordinated Discovery (CD) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries.  CD aims to provide a coherent experience across resource types—bibliographic, digital collections, article, etc.—while at the same time optimizing the experience of any one type.

Discovery across resource types is coordinated rather than aggregated in the sense that we do not provide a single global search as exemplified by the super-index products, e.g. Primo, Summon, EDS, nor do we aggregate results from difference sources on a single page bento box style.  In CD, patrons begin their searches against the index for a single resource type, e.g. digital collections, viewing search result sets and full record or object displays tuned to the features and behaviors of that type.  Behind the scenes a suggester service evaluates search parameters and propagates searches using local and vendor APIs to indexes for other appropriate resource types.   When results from these sidebar searches satisfy closeness-of-fit rules, we display in “ad space” sidebars links to these possibly interesting resources.  Transitions from searching one resource type to another are smoothed by forwarding the search to another resource “bucket”, along the lines of Google’s search interface.

This talk will discuss our motivations and philosophy for Coordinated Discovery and the technology and development we have invested in to support it.

  abstract: "The Fedora 4 repository offers message based workflows through Apache Camel. AWS Lambda offers serverless computing resources that allow you to only pay for the compute time you actually use. And, the Amazon API Gateway gives you a way to create Web APIs that expose these Lambda resources to other workflows on the Web (like Apache Camel's). This talk proposes to plumb the usefulness of integrating Camel workflows and AWS Lambda through Amazon's API Gateway. In a series of experiments, we'll look briefly at storing repository contents in S3, indexing metadata in AWS' ElasticSearch, sending email or text alerts about repository activity from AWS' SES/SNS, and logging repository events to CloudWatch. These are simple examples but serve as proof of concepts for more sophisticated Fedora and AWS integrations, such as spinning up on-demand image processing. While Apache Camel offers out-of-the-box AWS components, using AWS Lambda provides more flexibility in the process, giving you greater control over Fedora's integration with AWS' myriad of services, and it allows you to offload the work to Amazon's servers."

How would things change, if you rephrased the question to be user oriented like ”What are the problems I want library software to help solve for my users?”

Whether you are buying software or services or developing applications, changing the conversation about requirements from features sets to a focus on end-user problems can open the door to more creative and innovative solutions and build better collaborations with your developer colleagues, your library staff, and your service providers.

For example, when you think about APIs and integrations, providing a basic understanding of the problems you are trying to solve for the end-user creates the opportunity to review the multiple possible solution paths outside the context of existing system designs and capabilities.

This talk will focus on strategies and methods that you can use to reframe the conversations about library software to foster increased understanding and innovation within the library software ecosystem.

UXD deliverables should illuminate customer problems in a way that help your team ideate and design solutions your organization can uniquely solve. Wireframes, a popular UXD deliverable, can represent good design decisions when backed by smart user research – not magic or hunches. Wireframes without user flows defined and informed by user research can result in rework and delay as your team continues to ask: What happens when I click this?

In this presentation we’ll take a look at one of the most overlooked UXD deliverables, the user flow ⎯ sometimes called a journey map ⎯ and show how it can help clarify and visually explain a proposed solution to a known customer problem. By documenting both the current experience and the desired one, not only do user flows help everyone stay on the same page during design and development, they can also be a powerful tool for gaining user validation before investing in code or vendor arrangements.

  abstract: "Informed by our experience over the last decade developing CKAN, OpenSpending, and other data-driven projects, Open Knowledge International is keenly aware that there is too much friction involved in working with data.  We have identified a clear need for a lightweight and extensible format for describing data.  This specification, the “Data Package”, is the heart of what we call Frictionless Data.

Frictionless Data is an ongoing project for a set of tools, specifications, and best practices for describing, publishing, and validating data.  The mission is to remove the friction in working with data by making it easier for researchers and others to easily transport data among the tools and services that make the most sense for their work.  We have found that “packaging” data in a standard format enables the development, for example, of a generic framework for tabular data validation (see our “GoodTables” tool).

We have developed Python and JavaScript libraries as well as various framework integrations (e.g. with SQL and BigQuery).  We are piloting our approach across a variety of research disciplines, including neuroscientists and archaeologists, and we are seeing organic uptake among ecologists, energy data researchers, and others.

  presentation-title: "The Most Accessible Catalog Results Page Ever"
  abstract: "Although no one would argue that web accessibility is unimportant, the current state of library search catalogs indicates otherwise. Many existing products barely, if at all, pass the most basic of accessibility standards. Even then, an accessible site may not be efficiently usable for a disabled user. We certainly need to do better, but what would better (or even best) look like? Is displaying results in a list or table better for screen readers? Should we present more results via pagination, infinite scrolling, or a mix of the two?

Answering such questions is not immediately straightforward. Users of different [dis]abilities have different priorities on what makes a site both accessible and usable for them. We must also support the needs of other stakeholder groups beyond the catalog users. The site should not hinder library staff, including web designers customizing the look-and-feel and librarians working directly with patrons, from readily completing their duties. Thus, any design decision should clearly articulate the reasoning and tradeoffs among the competing priorities. Creating a “gold standard“ of accessibility for library search catalogs is certainly a difficult task but is not insurmountable. This talk will begin this conversation. Through code examples, I will discuss the needs, priorities, and complexities behind designing for the diverse understanding of accessibility necessary for building  the most accessible catalog results page ever."

With this in mind, Special Research Collections (SRC) at UC Santa Barbara is removing “digital“ as a premodifier,  not viewing born-digital processing as a separate unit but an embedded mechanism for all archivists to process collections. This shift includes a reinterpretation of building a born-digital program where archival processors lead in developing born digital policies and workflows as well as processing born-digital media themselves. This project aims to solve the issues of incorporating digital preservation holistically into SRC’s existing processing procedures, confronting the larger challenges of implementing total end- to-end digital archiving, while maintaining sustainability.

Techniques discussed will include clustering with Latent Dirichlet Allocations, feature vector generation using continuous bag of words (CBOW), and semantic encoding vectors built with neural networks like Doc2Vec. Additionally, classification, clustering, and recommendation techniques using the output of these models will be examined. Current research in these areas will be explored, including application to a variety of common text analysis problems.

The presentation will conclude with a demonstration of attempts to use Twitter profiles and recent tweets to build a search vector for querying DPLA according to vector cosine similarity and nearest neighbor algorithms."

  abstract: "You’ve probably faced some people within your organization who are fearful of change, especially technological change. It can be difficult to convince techno-leery individuals that technological change is imminent and can be exciting rather than scary. Changes can take the form of a web redesign, a new integrated library system, virtual servers, morphing roles of library vs. organization IT, etc. Convincing library stakeholders that change needs to happen can be a daunting task as a systems administrator, web developer, technology consultant, or technology manager. This presentation will frame technology projects as complex sales or “long sales;” it will also provide practical examples for modifying communication patterns to get people excited, or at least grudgingly accepting, of change.

Future mandates will include transparency of both government funded research as well as federal spending. Our panel will facilitate a conversation about the current state of open data in government and highlight several case studies of current initiatives at FDA’s Center for Device and Radiological Health. These initiatives include but are not limited to a data catalog, a research project database that includes current and past projects and their budget data, and our collaboration on the Data Curation Network project.

Additionally, we will assess techniques that worked and those that didn’t work, and processes that can be used to bridge the gap between high level regulations and local level work in other agencies and libraries.

Finally, we will discuss the possible implications of how the upcoming administration will prioritize the initiative going forward.

  abstract: "There are many paths to publishing linked data. One increasingly-popular method is using an extract, transform, load (ETL) process to transform existing data, stored in a data store such as a relational database, into linked data. The Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb) project aims to create an open repository of electronic resources metadata that is managed collaboratively by the library community. To facilitate this openness GOKb has successfully used ETL processes to transform metadata about e-resources, including titles, packages, holdings, platforms, and organizations, into linked data, which is loaded into a triple store and exposed through a SPARQL endpoint. This talk will focus on the GOKb linked data pilot, expanding on topics such as designing an appropriate linked data model and ETL pipeline. This pilot highlights a practical approach to exposing relational data as linked data and serves as an example of how linked open data can take your e-resource data to the next level."

  abstract: "Since 2014, the California Digital Library (CDL) has been piloting the use of a metadata harvesting infrastructure to aggregate unique collections from across the 10-campus University of California library system -- and libraries, archives, and museums throughout the state. These collections are now available through the newly redesigned Calisphere (http://calisphere.cdlib.org/) website in addition to the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Our metadata harvesting infrastructure, based on DPLA's early code base, allows us to harvest from a wide range of sources and pull much more content into Calisphere. However, there are challenges to scaling and streamlining this infrastructure: our processes for staging collections for harvest, adjusting metadata mappings, quality control checking results and performing re-harvests need to be more flexible and user-friendly in order to maximize available resources. This talk will provide an overview of our existing processes, including bottlenecks in the software stack and the growing pains of harvesting from more & more disparate sources. It will also cover an environmental scan we conducted to evaluate possible replacement software including DPLA's Heiðrún stack, Digital New Zealand's Supplejack,  and other large-scale aggregators. Last, we will discuss new requirements that we've developed in order to improve our processes and ramp up harvesting work. With these requirements in mind, we hope to adapt a tool that can provide fast-acting relief for all of our workflow woes!"

The centralized internet, and the rise of cloud services, has forced libraries to act as information silos that compete with other silos to be the place where content and metadata get stored.  We will look at how decentralized technologies allow libraries to break this pattern and resume their missions of providing discovery, access and preservation services on top of content that exists in multiple places.

  abstract: "As born-digital archives become a core part of archival processing, traditional processing archivists who lack Digital Archivist job titles face numerous challenges when meeting the processing and preservation needs of born-digital collections. Knowledge, skills, and institutional culture about who is responsible for the management of born-digital archives can all be barriers for practicing archivists in traditional processing roles. On the other hand, relying on the expertise of one Digital Archivist per institution is not a sustainable practice as it can overburden and overwork those in these roles. This presentation will focus on steps archivists can take to break through these barriers, based on the collaborative practices of the Manuscript Division processing team at Princeton University.

Our talk will discuss steps the Manuscripts Division has taken to manage its born-digital archives, including building our own digital processing workstation, creating extensible workflows, documentation, policies, and investigating means of access that have been informed through collaboration with our colleagues at Princeton and with those in the profession at large. Our hope is that sharing our experiences can empower more archivists to reach across their institutions and the profession to meet the challenges of managing born-digital collections no matter their job description entails."

Following up on Sibyl Schaefer’s 2015 talk “Designing and Leading a Kick A** Tech Team,” we’ll discuss how our small team of archivists provides ongoing technical leadership and expertise to our organization, an independent archive. Informed by sustained engagement with users, we strategically deploy low-cost, loosely coupled and easily maintainable (and abandon-able) tools that solve specific user needs and build political capital. Using staff turnover as an opportunity, we look for ways to build confidence and competence with technology across the organization, resulting in shared operational commitments and collaborative project management. Through informal horizontal skill-sharing, we value the existing expertise and labor of staff, break silos of tech knowledge, foster ethical computational thinking, and have fun experimenting, learning and teaching together."

  presentation-title: "Which One First When You Don't Have Either? Service Workflow and Application Design"
  abstract: "
A new library service often requires a custom application. Technologists - whether a developer or a librarian - are usually called in to gather specifications and build the application. By that point, ideally those specifications are already identified and the functions and tasks that the application are to perform are clear. In reality, however, a technologist often struggles with the insufficiently defined service workflow while the staff are unsure about how to define their workflow when they have not seen what the supporting application would look like, which they expect to closely rely on in their work.

What is a technologist to do in such a case? With two new library services, 3D printing and poster printing, as examples, this session will discuss how library technologists and library staff can resolve such a problem together by (1) breaking down the new service into individual actions, (2) attributing each action to either to a user, the application, or a staff member, and (3) fully describing and discussing each action and scenarios for potentially problematic cases. This participatory design process simultaneously addresses and articulates the staff workflow and the application design and can be used for adding new features in the future.

  abstract: "Over the years libraries have searched for software solutions to satisfy their needs. With the advent of open-source solutions suddenly we have great flexibility in the customizations that we can do to existing software products to fit our needs. But, have we gone too far? Are we making organizational decisions based on existing software tools rather than evaluating our needs and building solutions around them?

Building your own solution is not cheap, but neither is adapting an existing open-source solution. There are many advantages when building your own tool: your organization gets exactly what it needs, knows the code inside out, the architecture that supports it, and the organizational decisions behind it. Software maintenance on a known codebase is simpler than on a codebase that you inherited. What about the complexity of the code? A tool that does one specific thing for your organization is simpler than one that does many things that you might not need.

This session will cover pros and cons when deciding whether to build our own tool vs adopting an existing one, as well as the long-term considerations of creating and maintaining software systems that drive critical areas of our organizations. "

In Fall 2016, the University Library at California State University San Marcos [CSUSM] launched a comprehensive web presence assessment project. The goal of this assessment effort is to gather user feedback so as to meet the Library’s strategic goal of identifying and implementing improvements to the Library's online presence in order to increase awareness of, and access to, Library resources. This assessment effort utilized five methodologies: online surveys, in-person pop-up sessions, focus groups, 1-1 usability testing, and site usage analytics.



This presentation will focus on the rationale and value of utilizing in-person pop-up sessions. The presenters will describe the design of the pop-up sessions and discuss the value of utilizing this method alongside other assessment types. Findings from the pop-up assessments and the impact on the final redesign recommendation will also be discussed. The presentation will include lessons learned and how the CSUSM Library plans to incorporate pop-up sessions into its ongoing UX assessment program. Attendees will learn why and how they might implement a similar assessment methodology at their institution.  A template for building a series of pop-up sessions, and a description of the time and resource requirements, will be made available to attendees.

SolrMarc has been used by both Project Blacklight and VuFind to create the Solr index that they rely on for searching.  The new version provides a more powerful and more configurable index specification language that is backwards-compatible with the previous version but adds significant new capabilities such as conditional qualifiers, specification modifiers, multiple translation maps and support for dynamically-compiled custom indexing methods. It can work with different versions of Solr without needing to be re-compiled, and is easier to install, configure and upgrade.
Most importantly the new version greatly increases indexing speed by pre-compiling the indexing specification and using multi-threaded processing. Test runs on the entire University of Virginia database are over 17 times as fast as the previous version, indexing over 5 million records in about an hour.  Finally, it has an interactive user interface making it easier to create and debug index specifications."

  abstract: "What happens when money gets thrown at a problem for a limited period of time – not once, but twice?
A group of volunteers set out to redesign the ArchivesSpace Public User Interface (PUI) nearly two years ago with the goal of making it a premier tool for the public delivery of archival metadata. We had a budget, a vision, and not much else. Our problem was that we had to balance limited ArchivesSpace developer support with the fact that there are many ArchivesSpace users who are eager to see it evolve. As of 2016, in fact, ArchivesSpace has over 300 member organizations but less than ten percent use the current PUI. The audience is also global, since current users include The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, as well as The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Luckily, the entire ArchivesSpace application was built with internationalization in mind (primarily driven by YAML files) in addition to being backed by a solid data model. Time was needed to build support for a new design that would be accessible to as wide an audience as possible, however, which is why our development process has favored a “progressive enhancement” approach.
So what happened when we were confronted with this problem? We hope to prove that the persistence of a well-rounded, quality team has paid off. Good banter helped, too.

The novel slideshow structuring allows users to select paths through the content, moving downward to get additional information about a topic or skipping forward to bypass entry-level steps. This afforded agency respects users time, but is still comprehensive. For example, in Introduction to Zotero, we offer users text installation instructions, in-depth videos if they need them and the ability to bypass the whole section if need be.

While significant consideration is given as to the impact these new technologies will have on our budgets, few libraries take the time to analyze the impact this unfamiliar tech will have on library staff.
At the JPL Library, one staff member is in charge of all things technical: me. For the past three years, this has included two very temperamental 3D Printers. Diving head first, I have over time taught myself the basic principles of additive manufacturing, printer maintenance and repair, and have developed user guidelines from the ground up. I have learned first–hand the true costs of these 3D printers for my library – not only their financial cost, but their effects on my daily work as well.
This talk will describe how the printers were obtained through a fruitful partnership with JPL’s Office of the Chief Intelligence Officer, and will examine how their acquisition has benefited library patrons and the JPL community alike. More importantly, however, it will be a candid conversation about the printers’ significant impact on my daily workload, with suggestions for fellow frontline staff on how to ease the pain and mediate their library’s eagerness for new tech with a practical ground game. The talk will advocate that any library considering an investment in emergent technology should think beyond their bottom line, incorporating the needs of technical staff in their cost analysis."

  abstract: "Linked data promises to make library metadata more accessible and powerful. The clearly-defined URIs of linked data will form chains that lead to new connections and insights. But is there a flip side to such sharply-delineated data? Real life is messy and natural language doesn’t come with precise definitions. How will catalogers work in an environment that seems to require black-and white conclusions? What happens when you only have incomplete information and it’s impossible or impractical to obtain the missing details. Sometimes the information you find is contradictory with no clear resolution. Some things fit neatly into categories and some things don’t. Some questions don’t have objective, factual answers. Sometimes you don’t have the expertise to identify the answer. Sometimes user needs are in tension. Of course, these problems confront catalogers now, but they will become more prominent and problematic as we rely more on machine-actionable metadata.

Are there things that we might lose in the transition to linked data? How much will we be able to infer from converted data? What about the things that RDF isn’t so good at, such as grouping and ordering metadata statements?

This presentation will look at some challenges for cataloging in a linked data environment and discuss some possible approaches to handling them."

  abstract: "At Code4Lib 2014, Sumana Harihareswara delivered a keynote titled, “UX Is A Social Justice Issue.” Harihareswara encouraged attendees to practice a disciplined empathy in the work of designing library services, because “a better user experience is the best force multiplier we have at our command.”

This inspirational keynote motivated a new initiative at the Montana State University Library: User Experience with Underrepresented Populations (UXUP). The goal of the UXUP project is to create better user experiences for all users in our community—from the mainstream to the margin. To achieve this goal, we followed the methodology of Participatory Design, which has its roots in Scandinavian industrial design of the 1980s. Participatory Design begins with the idea that the user and the designer each possess skills and perspectives of equal worth. This equity is realized through a practice of collaborative power-sharing and decision-making that deeply connects the user with the design outcome. For the UXUP project, our library worked with our Native American community to develop a participatory design practice anchored by a Native American student group empowered to make design decisions.

This talk will overview our design methods, including website usability and emotional response assessment, journey mapping, interviews, and the student working group. We will also describe our design outcomes, including outreach programming, website enhancements, and physical space improvements. The UXUP project can serve as a model for empathetic and collaborative design, with the ultimate outcome of creating more inclusive library experiences for all users. "

  abstract: "Metadata is frequently cited as the most significant cost of a digital library project. As such, care should be taken to ensure that when metadata is created, it is done in such a way that its quality will not be low enough to be a liability to current and future library applications. Agile software development uses the concept of “technical debt“ to place metrics on the ongoing costs associated with low-quality code, and determine resource allocation for strategies to improve it.

This talk presents the technical debt metaphor in the context of metadata management, identifies common themes across the qualitative and quantitative literature related to technical debt, and connects them to similar themes in the literature on metadata quality assessment. It presents a set of metrics for determining metadata management debts and taking steps to pay them down. Finally, it concludes with areas of future research in the area of technical debt and metadata management, and ways in which the metaphor may be integrated into other current avenues of metadata research."

  presentation-title: "Introducing Archival Principles into UCLA Undergraduate Courses with Digital Humanities Projects"
  abstract: "The world of digital humanities is rapidly growing, and if student digital humanities projects are to be seen as robust and legitimate research, then the emerging literacies skills necessary to produce that high level of research, including primary sources; proper attributions and citations; and clear metadata and documentation need to be integrated into classroom as part of the syllabus.

As a Civic Engagement Fellow with the UCLA Center for Jewish Studies, I worked with CJS faculty and staff to integrate archival literacy into the syllabus for two digital humanities/service learning courses. Over time, I learned to distill my archival literacy instruction down to the basics in order balance the needs of the students with the needs of the university to maintain an accurate archival record. I have found that due to the short academic terms, it is most effective and less intimidating for students to use tools with which they have some familiarity. Thus, CJS faculty, staff, and I have encouraged students to use their smart phones (or another device they already own) to record interviews and take high-resolution photographs of artifacts; upload images onto a classroom Dropbox account set up with a hierarchal folder structure specific to the project; and describe artifacts and capture metadata through a simplified archival data entry form created through Google Forms and customized for each course.

The timing in making sure students provide clear metadata and documentation for the work they contribute is critical given the transient nature of undergraduate students who are typically only in a course for a term. Once an academic term has passed, it is infinitely more difficult to retroactively gather any information or metadata not already provided to the department or university.

As universities begin to incorporate digital humanities projects into undergraduate courses in a wide range of disciplines, there is a growing need for information professionals to collaborate with faculty to introduce archival principles into the course in order to ensure an accurate archival record of student work and contribution to these projects as the courses unfold. Faculty and information professionals, then, should be encouraged to collaborate and set up an infrastructure for the course in which students learn archival principles and why it is important for research and then have the chance to put the principles into practice through following simplified professional standards in archival description and digitization.

  presentation-title: "Apps on a Platform: Thinking Outside the Monolithic Box"
  abstract: "Apps on a platform is a growing paradigm -- iOS and Android, Salesforce’s Force, and Google’s G Suite are examples.  FOLIO is an app platform created for the needs of libraries.  With built-in support for descriptive metadata, patrons, and other library-related content types, FOLIO provides a toolkit for app developers to build new functionality atop traditional data sources.  FOLIO is also a user-experience-centered project; the user interface is designed and tested first using a prototyping tool and then the code is created to match.  The platform is providing libraries an avenue for thinking “outside the monolithic box“ for new ways to provide services to patrons.


Participants will learn how the user interface prototype informs code development and how data in the domain models are expressed within the RESTful microservices.  Participants will also learn about  the roadmap for the platform and app development through to the minimum viable product expected in 2018.  Lastly, participants will hear about the community of users engaging in FOLIO development and how to join in."

  presentation-title: "“Perfect” Data in a Crowd-Sourced, Open-Access World:  Perspectives from the New Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts Project"
  abstract: "Handing data creation and maintenance over to users in a crowd-sourced environment, as we are doing with the New Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, raises the intertwined problems of modeling, user-engagement, community building, and data quality. With data drawn from auction and sale catalogues and other sources dating back to the 15th century, and now our users’ own personal observations, the SDBM assists researchers in locating pre-1600 manuscript books from Europe, Asia, and Africa, establishing provenance, and aggregating descriptive information. Building on a robust search and discovery interface in the old SDBM, the new SDBM provides its user community with the means to actively contribute and maintain the data as a by-product of their own research process.
        In creating this resource--launched in beta in August 2016 with a final release planned for Spring 2017--the project team has had to grapple with several issues concerning data integrity and quality in a crowd-sourced workflow: What does our data represent? What role does the user play in the health of the data? How do you maintain good description standards that will enable searching and access without intimidating the non-specialist? When is it appropriate to lower standards? How do you manage user expectations when data isn’t “perfect”? What is “perfect” data? We discuss how the new data model determines user expectations and experience to ensure a commitment to the truth of what the data represents and to the long term sustainability of the project.

  presentation-title: "You’ll probably like this one, too: Using circulation data to automate recommendations in a special collections library"
  abstract: "Book recommendation systems are increasingly common, from Amazon to public library interfaces. However, in the land of archives and special collections, such automated assistance has been rare. This is partly due to the the complexity of descriptions -- EADs describing whole collections -- and partly due to the complexity of the collections themselves -- what is this collection “about“, and how is it related to another collection?

The American Philosophical Society Library is using circulation data collected through Aeon to automate recommendations. In our system, recommendations are offered in two ways: based on interests (“You’re interested in X, other people interested in X looked at these collections“) and on specific requests (“You’ve looked at finding aid Y, other people who looked at finding aid Y also looked that these finding aids“).

We will discuss the development of this system, the central role of patron privacy, possibilities for generalizing the project for other environments, and future plans. We will also discuss ongoing concerns and issues. For example, do these recommendations increase the use of already highly used collections at the expense of less well-known resources? What nuance are we missing by focusing on the collection-level data, and what alternatives could be developed?"

  presentation-title: "BibCard & the Bibliographic Data Crawl for Library Discovery"
  abstract: "This talk will present on work at UW-Madison to enhance the library catalog with info cards for the authors of bibliographic works using Linked Open Data sources. At the heart of this work is BibCard (https://github.com/UW-Madison-Library/bibcard), a Ruby gem that serves as a reference implementation for working with bibliographic and Linked Data. Included in this presentation will be a discussion of working with RDF, graph structures and SPARQL in a web application environment. Discussion will include issues of speed, availability and reliability of Linked Open Data sets and the implications for suitability with core library services and possible solutions, such as caching strategies, to dealing with them. The goal of this work is to explore ways to provide greater context for library resources from data sets on the Web that are not traditionally curated by libraries."
