  # Name: Daniel Aitken
  # Bio: |
    # Daniel has been working for discoverygarden since 2013, and was dubbed "QA Dan" early on due to an organizational overload of Dans at that time. Since then, he's gone on to shore up the automated testing and delivery of Islandora components, quality check more pieces of the Islandora framework than he can actually remember, and now works fully on the development side of the project. He keeps the moniker, though, as it would be too much of a hassle to change his twitter handle and GitHub credentials over at this point.
