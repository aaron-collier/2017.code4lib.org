<p>This Ally Skills Workshop is based on curriculum developed by the Ada Initiative and Frame Shift Consulting. The workshop teaches simple, everyday ways to be an ally to marginalized people in our workplaces and communities. Participants learn techniques that work at the office, at conferences, and online. The skills taught are relevant everywhere, including those particularly relevant to open technology and culture communities. At the end of the workshop, participants will feel more confident in speaking up to support marginalized people, will be more aware of the challenges facing marginalized groups in their workplaces and communities, and have closer relationships with the other participants. Please note, previous versions of this workshop focused on supporting women in technology; this is an updated curriculum that has been expanded to include questions of racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia.
