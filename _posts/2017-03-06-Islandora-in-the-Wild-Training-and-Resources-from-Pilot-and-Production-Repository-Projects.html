<p>Islandora is an open source digital repository framework used to preserve and expose special collections, scholarly publications and research data. It combines the Drupal CMS and Fedora Commons repository software, together with additional open source applications. The framework delivers a wide range of functionality out-of-the-box and offers the flexibility of customization to meet emerging functional requirements.

This Islandora workshop will explore multiple uses and implementations of Islandora by community members such as Betsy Coles from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Zach Vowel of the California Polytechnic State University (Calpoly), Aaron Krebeck of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), and others. They will describe their digital projects, how Islandora was utilized, overall experience, and top takeaways.

The workshop will cover topics such as:
- Single site and Consortial Repositories (governance, management, sustainability)
- Metadata Wrangling (pre-processing, batch updating and XML forms)
- Content Modelling Advancements (EADs, TEI, and more)
- Batch Ingesting Content (via Drupal UI and Drush shell scripts)
- Discovery & Harvesting (Solr, Search Engines, DPLA and more)

All examples will be taken from both pilot and production repositories. Users will leave with an understanding of the Islandora software framework and community, the underpinnings of Islandora content modelling and metadata requirements, the ability to batch ingest content, and the knowledge of how to expose repository content to search engines and aggregators for discovery and re-use.  We look forward to seeing you there! </p>
