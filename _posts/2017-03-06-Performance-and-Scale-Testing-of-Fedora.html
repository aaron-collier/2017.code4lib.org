title: Performance and Scale Testing of Fedora
---
<p>One of the driving requirements of a digital repository is that it continue to be performant as it scales. In that theme, significant community effort has gone into the testing of Fedora’s performance characteristics.

This session will offer:
1. A brief, hands-on, survey of interacting with Fedora
2. An update on Fedora’s performance and scale testing status
3. A collaborative activity in defining future-facing testing requirements
4. Some hacking on new, repeatable testing scripts
