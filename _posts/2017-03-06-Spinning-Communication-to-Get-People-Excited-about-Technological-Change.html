title: Spinning Communication to Get People Excited about Technological Change
---
<p>You’ve probably faced some people within your organization who are fearful of change, especially technological change. It can be difficult to convince techno-leery individuals that technological change is imminent and can be exciting rather than scary. Changes can take the form of a web redesign, a new integrated library system, virtual servers, morphing roles of library vs. organization IT, etc. Convincing library stakeholders that change needs to happen can be a daunting task as a systems administrator, web developer, technology consultant, or technology manager. This presentation will frame technology projects as complex sales or “long sales;” it will also provide practical examples for modifying communication patterns to get people excited, or at least grudgingly accepting, of change. </p>
