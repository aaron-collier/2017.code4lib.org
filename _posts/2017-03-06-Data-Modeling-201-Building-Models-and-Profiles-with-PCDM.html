title: Data Modeling 201&#58; Building Models and Profiles with PCDM
---
<p>This will be a half-day, hands-on workshop covering data modeling primarily in RDF, building on the separately-proposed “Data Modeling 101” workshop. Participation in Data Modeling 101 is not necessary, but attendees should have a basic familiarity with data modeling and/or RDF. The focus for the afternoon workshop is the hands-on, collaborative creation of examples and models for digital objects using the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) and other linked data vocabularies. Participants should bring types of objects they want to model, and if possible, provide additional information such as sample records, a METS profile, diagrams, or other documentation. We expect this session will produce PCDM (or other models) examples, documentation, model extensions and work that will be shared back with the broader PCDM community.</p>
