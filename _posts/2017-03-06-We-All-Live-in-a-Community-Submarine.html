<p>Community-oriented projects keep library technology vibrant, and can provide life support in those times when it could otherwise sink. Whether open source or not, a stated commitment to community is something that we tend to  look for in choosing a technical solution, digital project, or professional development opportunity. Understanding how to effectively and ethically improve community around a project--at whatever scale--can improve the project. I will present an analysis of the community efforts around a variety of library technology projects, from large, well-funded, and well-known to small but feisty efforts. Learn from history what works to grow and maintain a diverse community, potential pitfalls, and how to make it happen no matter how tiny you start.
