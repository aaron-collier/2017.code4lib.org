title: Curation, Collaboration, and Coding—The Secret Sauce for Scholarship Support
---
<p>This half-day workshop is an overview and hands-on introduction to the Open Science Framework and the SHARE data set, two tools that form a powerful combination for supporting scholarship and research locally as well as improving scientific integrity and allowing for new forms of meta-research.


Developed by the Center for Open Science, the Open Science Framework (OSF; http://osf.io) is a free, open source tool that works within the research workflow to allow for better management, curation, streamlining, and sharing of scholarly outputs. SHARE builds its free, open, data set (https://share.osf.io/) by gathering, cleaning, linking, and enhancing metadata that describe research activities and outputs—from data management plans and grant proposals to research data and code, to preprints, presentations, and journal articles.


In this workshop, participants will learn to use the OSF to develop embedded data stewardship and research management services for faculty. Attendees will also learn how to leverage and enhance SHARE data to improve their institutions’ understanding of the whole scholarship ecosystem happening on their campuses.


This workshop will be divided into two parts. First, attendees will learn strategies to provide curation and research services to the faculty workflow by operating in the OSF. Practical approaches to faculty collaborations and curation assistance throughout the research life cycle will be discussed. The second part will focus on harnessing the power of the SHARE data set to discover and act upon the research outputs of an institution or organization. This hands-on portion of the workshop will use IPython/Jupyter Notebooks to access the SHARE API and search across 129+ different providers and export and clean the metadata.

Participants are encouraged to bring laptops in order to follow along. No previous programming experience is necessary.


Learning Outcomes:
Understand how the OSF works within the researcher workflow and how it can improve scientific integrity while also fostering collaboration.
Learn to leverage the SHARE API to better understand the intellectual and scientific contributions of a university.
Develop an understanding of the basics of good data-management practices.</p>
