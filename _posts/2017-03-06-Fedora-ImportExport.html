<p>Applications are constantly improving and evolving. The applications we use today will be replaced by those of tomorrow. From a continuity and preservation perspective, maintaining our data through time is a critical requirement in this dynamic environment. With that in mind, the Fedora community is focused on ensuring that content can be imported and exported over standard protocols in standard serializations.


Introducing, the Fedora Import/Export tool. This tool is under active development, intending to provide robust and flexible import/export functionality for migrating data, packaging data for preservation, and other uses.  This session will provide an overview of the development and requirements gathering that has gone into building the tool, an update on implementation efforts, and guidance on how the tool compares to other import/export/backup/restore tools.  Attendees will get hands-on experience using the tool to export from, and import data into, a Fedora repository running on their laptops.  Finally, we'll discuss planned improvements to the tool, and solicit feedback on future development efforts.</p>
