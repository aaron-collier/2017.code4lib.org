title: How Do We Keep Voting?&#58; Sustaining Open Source Tools in a Community-Driven Environment: Diebold-o-tron Case Study
---
<p>This session will take these concerns and focus the case study of diebold-o-tron, Code4Lib’s trusty voting software, currently maintained and deployed annually through the generosity of individuals.  Applying strategies for sustaining software in an Open Source community discussed in the related morning session, we will, as a group, develop a pilot strategy for treating conference voting as a service maintained by the Code4Lib community rather than a piece of software maintained by an individual.  

Attendees will come away with:
New perspectives on software’s role in a service-based organizational ecosystem
Strategies for building team models needed to sustainably support software in a community or organization
Methods for identifying healthy Open Source projects and programming languages to develop a sustainable infrastructure

Sustainable software is developed at many levels beyond the code itself.  For this workshop, we seek the input and collaboration of everyone in the Code4Lib community -- service and project managers, developers, and most of all, users.
