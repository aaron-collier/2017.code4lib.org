title: Implementing Proximity Beacons at an Academic Library
---
<p>In the 2015-2016 academic year librarians at San Diego State University strategically deployed proximity beacons throughout the library. The beacons delivered informational websites to users via their mobile phones upon entering specific areas of the library building. This presentation will talk about the Google Eddystone beacons selected for this project, and the experience of the library developing and marketing the project. The challenges encountered programming for the beacons will also be discussed.</p>
