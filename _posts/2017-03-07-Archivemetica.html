<p>Archivematica is an an integrated suite of open-source software tools that allows users to carry out digital preservation on existing and new digital content in their libraries, archives, and museums. As a tool suite, Archivematica has always been part of an ecosystem of digital library platforms. This presentation will review two of Archivematicaâ€™s vital integrations - a long-standing but ever-growing integration with ArchivesSpace, and more recent projects to enable Archivematica to work with Hydra.
