title: Information Architecture&#58; what is it and where does it fit?
---
<p>Information architecture (IA) can be a powerful tool for clarifying who you are as a library and what youâ€™re doing both for your staff and for your users. Yet the IA skillset and the actual work that is done to produce an IA is rarely defined clearly. This talk will discuss ways in which IA work can support organizational change by establishing a common language and aligning it with how we present the work we do.

We will define what IA competencies are for librarians, discuss what IA can and cannot do for you, and provide examples of what IA work looks like. This will be presented from the perspective of web-based IA design and implementation but address IA broadly.
