<p>Micro-volunteering is an easy, low commitment, and time-bound volunteer assignment. It is a 'byte-sized' way to make a difference by helping with micro tasks or sharing expertise, and lends itself to workplace volunteering. This presentation will provide an introduction to micro-volunteering, including benefits, how to create a micro-volunteering project, platforms, and volunteer management. From repository development to digital curation, we will share examples of utilizing micro-volunteers to bootstrap library technology projects. We will also discuss lessons learned and how micro-volunteering can be leveraged for no-cost professional development and employee engagement.    </p>
