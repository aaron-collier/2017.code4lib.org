<p>The ArchivesSpace application was first released in 2013 and its community has grown substantially in the years since. Recent changes in staffing and leadership of the program have provided us with an excellent opportunity to evaluate our progress, examine our activities and assess how best to work together as a community to bring ArchivesSpace into the future. This presentation will describe the program’s current direction and some ways we intend to encourage broader participation of the ArchivesSpace community and development in the months and years to come.</p>
