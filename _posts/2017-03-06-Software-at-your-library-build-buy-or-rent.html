<p>Iâ€™ll present a poster with three blank categories: build, buy or rent? Attendees will be encouraged to add sticky notes with the name of a software product and why their libraries chose to build, buy, or rent that software. This poster will start lively conversations on topics such as: Is using free and open source software building, buying, or something else? Why should you buy and host software locally when you can rent the latest version of the software (and hardware) in the cloud? What happens to your data when you have to change from one mode to another? </p>
