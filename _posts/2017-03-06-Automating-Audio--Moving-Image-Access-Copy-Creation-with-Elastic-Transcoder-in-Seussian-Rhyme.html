title: Automating Audio & Moving Image Access Copy Creation with Elastic Transcoder, in Seussian Rhyme
---
<p>HTML5 has become the preferred, widely supported method of serving video
on the web. This is a tools talk...but not an Amazon sales pitch.
I was genuinely surprised at how easy, yet flexible ET is - and how well
it dovetails with Amazon's other services and I think other people will be just as surprised.

Over the last year, NYPL has been focused on transcoding decades/terabytes worth of archival quality video into high-quality HTML 5 accessible video. Using AWS has allowed us to focus on making the media and its technical and intellectual metadata available without having to own the responsibility of running and monitoring a fleet of transcoding machines.</p>
