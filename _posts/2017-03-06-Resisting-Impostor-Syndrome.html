<p>Impostor syndrome, common among under-represented groups in technology work and academia, is the feeling that you aren't qualified for the work you are doing and will be exposed as a fraud. This workshop will discuss the syndrome and lead participants through writing and discussion exercises designed to combat it. This workshop is based on curriculum developed by the Ada Initiative, and builds on published and replicated research shown to reduce feelings of impostor syndrome.
